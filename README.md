# SleighTheList

Stressed out about the crazy about of gifts you need to come up with for your family and friends as the Christmas countdown rapidy approaches? Well, Fear no more ...

Sleigh the List is an innovative, conveinent, & social approach to Christmas gift shopping! 

This web app opens to a user's home page, where they can view and add items to their holiday wish list, as well as specift whether each wish is a "need" or a "want." 

From here, visit your friends list, where family and other connections can post their gift wishes for you to grant. See a gift on their list you really want to bless them with? You can claim a gift to indicate to their connections that you'll be buying that item soon. Then, once it's purchased come back to indicate that item is taken care of.
